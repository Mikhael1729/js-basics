# JavaScript

## History

- ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) was created on May 17, 1960. The members were the main do machines companies.

## Variables

- `const`: Allows you to store constant values.
- `let`: Allows you to store variable values.
- `var`: The same as let + you can use it before initialize it.

## Considerations

- You can't add many times the same element. The DOM only adds new elements.

## Examples

- `scrip2`. You can see examples of creating and manipulating elements in the DOM using JS.
